You Can visit my website at shortto.com/qazimaazarshad


This is code of my portfolio website. This is one of the best projects I have worked on till now because I was really amazed by a few portfolio websites of my LinkedIn connections and decided to built my own. It is a static website designed using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, my website is divided into multiple sections like navigation bar with links to all my social accounts, then  a button to download my resume then a carousel view of my education, another section giving an insights of my past experience alongside a section listing all my skills and projects with links to project destination, the last section tells about my hobbies, in the footer their is a small introduction about me and links to all my social profiles also a few images showing insights of my Instagram profile and a button which takes you straight to the top of this website so you don't have to scroll all the way up. I created this portfolio website because I wanted to showcase my work in a more attractive way and it gives employers a great first impression and shows I'm more than just a resume.
